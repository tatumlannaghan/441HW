This week I felt really able to understand what was happening with javascript. I also originally wanted to add a photo onto my webpage but still can't figure out what I'm doing wrong there so I added a video instead. 

I think I'm going to start check websites to see if there is anything funny or interesting in peoples console logs. I think it could be really interesting to see. 

Overall feeling good about this week.
