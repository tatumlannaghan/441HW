I was struggling with this week. I was a little confused by the instructions so I hope I did the right thing by having only one photo and then the other information be about that same photo. I could not figure out how to get the image to show by clicking so I decided to just have it show anyway. I think I was over thinking it but I left how I thought it would work in my java.js file.
