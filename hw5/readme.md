This week I had a lot of fun. I like the overall look of the website as well.

Unfortunately when I try to view the website through "https://tatumlannaghan.github.io/441HW/hw5/" it doesn't show but when I use "file:///Users/tatumlannaghan/Desktop/441HW/hw5/index.html" it works just fine. I'm hoping that's something on my end because it's worked every time before.

If it doesn't show up, I've included screenshots of what I'm seeing. Really hope that's something to do on my end because it looks super cool.
