This week was tough for me. I've had a lot of personal stuff going on that's made it hard for me to do any kind of work. I just want to lay in my bed most of the time. 
I did my best for the homework this week. I tried to add a restart button but it just wasn't working so i took it out. 
Sorry this isn't my best work. Hopefully I'll do better next week. Thanks.
