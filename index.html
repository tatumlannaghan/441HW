                A Little About Me!

            <p>
                I was born and raised in Montana. I am on my last semester at the University of Montana, graduating with a degree in Media Arts with a focus in filmmaking. I started taking coding classes during my second year and I like the creative side of it. It also really interests me to understand how websites are created since I use them everyday. My prior experience in coding just involves assignments from classes.

            <h2>
                A Little More About Me!
            </h2>
             <p> I just got a kitten, her name is Friday and she is a crazy little lady. She is a girl orange cat which is super rare. I'm very lucky to have her around, but no one tell my landlord.  </p>

            I have also recently learned how to crochet. I've made a few beanies and a sweater for my kitten.

            <h2>
                My Main Theme
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm not sure what this section means. If we are talking main theme of my life I'd say it's recently been updated to maybe a "crazy cat lady" due to my recent crocheting skill and getting a cat.

                If we are talking main theme of the website, I'd say I went simple. I like simple.
