            <p>
                I was born and raised in Montana. I am on my last semester at the University of Montana, graduating with a degree in Media Arts with a focus in filmmaking. I started taking coding classes during my second year and I like the creative side of it. It also really interests me to understand how websites are created since I use them everyday. My prior experience in coding just involves assignments from classes.
