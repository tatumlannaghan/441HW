This week I was struggling because I could not remember a lot of the things I learned from the previous course. There were tons of different techniques I wanted to add to showcase my skills I remember from that previous course and I found myself getting frustrated whenever it didn't work how I remember. Which is also why my design is a little simpler that I would like. I think taking more time for my homework next week will lead to a better representation of my skillset along with studying up on what I learned last course.

I also really did not understand the fetch / push thing and found that it would take a really long time for something to update on my website that I coded. This would lead to me deleting things and getting frustrated on something that could've potentially worked out had it updated. Maybe that is something on my end? I'm not sure.
